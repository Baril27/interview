# Mobile Take Home Excercise

Create a car shopping app using Swift for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android

The app should have atleast these three main functionalities:
* Finding a car
  * A user should be able to find the car they are interested in via a car browsing or searching interface
* Viewing car details
  * Once a user selects a car, they should be able to view details information for that vehicle, these are the minium requirements:
    * images
    * vehicle information
    * links to articles for this car
* Directions to dealership
  * There should be an call to action on the vehicle details page that shows them the nearest dealerships for that car's manufacture near them, and show them the direction to getting there.
    * Do not worry about small manufactures where the dealerships are very sparse.

# Data Source
You should be able to source the vehicle make / model data, articles, and dealer by brand via edmund's API: http://developer.edmunds.com/api-documentation/overview/

# Vehicle Images Source
Unforunately there is no free image apis available for cars, but luckily we can use truecar's image urls for our demo needs, here are some sample urls:
https://a.tcimg.net/v/model_images/v1/2014/gmc/acadia/all/190x97/side
https://a.tcimg.net/v/model_images/v1/2014/gmc/acadia/all/190x97/f3q
https://a.tcimg.net/v/model_images/v1/2017/gmc/acadia-limited/all/360x185/side
https://a.tcimg.net/v/model_images/v1/2017/gmc/acadia-limited/all/360x185/f3q

Plug in the correct year / make / model / trim with data from the edmunds api, and the urls will return an image if there are matchs, or a placeholder image if nothing is there. Don't worry too much about accuracy here, as long as your app demonstrates that it can pull atleast some images correctly.

* feel free to use your own source for car images if available, but they must be hosted and accessed asynchronously. The image source should also be in the public domain so reviewers can view the app without special setups.

# Testing
There should be atleast some high level test coverage of the basic functionalities of your app, demonstrating your ability to test your code.

# Bonus points
For anything that you think would make your demo stand out, i.e. none traditional navigation methods, cool presentation / animation styles
